# Travelogue  
Travelogue is a mobile application designed to simplify organizing and preserving travel memories. It acts as a digital scrapbook where users can create personalized journals for their trips, store multimedia, and interactively track their travels on a world map. Travelogue ensures that your focus remains on the memories, not the hustle of organizing them.
